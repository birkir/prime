Prime is a standalone, self-hosted, headless CMS with a GraphQL interface powered by TypeScript.

## Why Prime?

There are a lot of headless SaaS solutions out there, and many of them better than Prime, but sometimes there is a need to host the CMS locally and while most open source projects work well for that, they are missing key features.
